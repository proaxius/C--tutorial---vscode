this chapter covers how to compile and build c++ proj also this also includes the compiling lib

1 gcc {chapter1_gcc has build file of gcc}
2 cmake {in CMakeFiles /chapter1_cmake_builds} { i have ignored any cmake dir but if you run " cmake . " from dir of chapter1 it will generate all the files but lookout for file and paths and dont try to install any cmake files they are for portability goodluck! you can check the program from gcc compiler output in later chapters we wil learn to runmore complex programs}
