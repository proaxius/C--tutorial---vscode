ok this is chapter 5 and the msot important topic that was we were waiting i was also trying to start is going to be covered in this chapter
loops and statements

step1: lets start with if (){}
step2:  but if doesnt sit right without else()
step3 lets tru else if(){} << lets do this via a custom function
for beginners a function is a piece of code which does its thing for which it is programmed or written for it in technical terms you give a fucnction a request and in return it gives you response except void type this guy doesn't return anything just does its thing and exits the program
lets start create funciton as 

string else_if  ()  {  }
_____  =======  ""  ****

let me break this  
_____ this is data return type in what type 
      function return is going to be the first term that funciton initialised 

===== this is function name

""  this for parameter or telling function what terms we give him the request

**** this is the code area

in the end we need to call that function in our main fucntion to tell c++ that here run this function
call function by doing this

else_if();
and  here was the first goal now lets do another with for  and while but in a separate file lets start naming out exports also 
i dont like typing again and again so just named as 5b.cpp
