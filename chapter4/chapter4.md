lets start  with operators
the most commonly used operator is assignment operator

Arithmetic operators

addition = +
        +++
        +++         
        +++         
+++++++++++++++++++         
+++++++++++++++++++         
        +++         
        +++
        +++


subtraction operator
subtraction = -

 multiplication = *
              
           dP     
       8b. 88 .d8 
        `8b88d8'  
        .8P88Y8.  
       8P' 88 `Y8 
           dP     
                  


DIvision operator

division = /

       //
      //
     //
    //
   //
  //
 //
//

modulo = %

             //
  0000      //         
 00  00    //           
 00  00   //           
  0000   //  0000       
        //  00  00       
       //   00  00   
      //     0000        
     // 

now it is getting really a pain to draw these symbols so iam just gonna do stuff 

compound assignment operators
remember most of the times you are going to use compound assignment operators in loops
x += y  this means x = x + y 
x -= y  this means x = x - y
x /= y  this means x = x / y
x *= y  this means x = x * y

lets understand two more concepts easy to understand and are ver commonly used
 increment = ++ equals to = + 1
 decrement = -- equals to = - 1

now mostly known as Relational and commonly operators
 == equals to 
 != not equal to 
 < less than
 > greater than
 <= less than or equal to
 >= greater than or equal to

 one of the most powerful and important 
 logical operator

 ! ,&&, ||

! inverts whatever value is given mostly bool 
!true
!false

&&
&& this guy here is like and operator from logic gates always  giving one sigle relational result where things go like 0 * 1 = 0 
example 
|   a        |     b     |         |
| 0  | false | 0 | false | 0 false |
| 0  | false | 1 | true  | 0 false |
| 1  | true  | 0 | false | 0 false |
| 1  | true  | 1 | true  | 1 true  |

|| operator 
this guy reminds of OR operator where things go like 0 + 1 = 1
|   a        |     b     |          |
| 0  | false | 0 | false | 0 false  |
| 0  | false | 1 | true  | 1 true   |
| 1  | true  | 0 | false | 1 true   |
| 1  | true  | 1 | true  | 1 true   |

one important thing operator s only work in direction left to right

for eg 

lets say if a < 5 && a++ here things go like if a has value less than 5 then right hand side will be done but  if left hand side is not true things will not go further



conditional operator 
? yeah this guy a big question mark
this guy gives vibes of [if] just like kids do if this happens then this goes like this and then whatever goes OK i am just making a point
lets say  5 == 5        ?      true             :        false 
        |condition| operator  output if true         output if false
        eqn +>  5 =5 ? true : false
        lets do another
        a + 10 == 20 ? a = 10 : a = is not equal to 20;

so lets start coding now ( operator are going to be studied further more so this readme files will grow )
